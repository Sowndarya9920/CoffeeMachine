:hotel: Our Coffee machine will contain the ingredients to make coffee i.e., milk, water, and coffee beans.

:hotel: There would be different types of coffee that can be selected which will have separate prices and amounts of ingredients required. The types of coffee are:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### :coffee: Espresso
- :heavy_dollar_sign: price - $4/cup, :potable_water: water needed – 250 ml/cup, :milk_glass: milk needed – 0 ml/cup, :coffee: beans needed - 16/cup
#### :coffee: Latte
- :heavy_dollar_sign: price - $7/cup, :potable_water: water needed – 350 ml/cup, :milk_glass: milk needed – 75 ml/cup,  :coffee: beans needed - 20/cup
#### :coffee: Cappuccino
- :heavy_dollar_sign: price - $6/cup, :potable_water: water needed – 200 ml/cup , :milk_glass: milk needed – 100 ml/cup , :coffee: beans needed - 12/cup.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:hotel: There should be a “buy” option which enables the user to buy a coffee of their choice. The coffee would be dispensed only if the machine contains enough ingredients to make that coffee otherwise it will show an error message. 

:hotel: After coffee is dispensed, money in our box will be updated as well as remaining ingredients. There should be a “fill” 
option which lets us add the ingredients as the user specifies. 

:hotel: There should be a “take” option which enables the maintainer to take the money in the money box. There should be a “show” 
option which enables the user to check the ingredients left in the coffee machine. 

:hotel: There should be an “exit” option which stops the simulation.
